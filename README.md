## What ?
This work is currently extremely early, and the repository only contains ideas and bikeshedding for now. The goal is to create a multiplayer board game engine where people can create game packages (such as [Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker) or [Game of the Goose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Goose)) to play locally at home with your friends or remotely through a server.

## How ?
See the [current discussion](docs/architecture.md) for our plans on how we'd like to proceed.
